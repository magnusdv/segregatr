The goal of **segregatr** is to provide segregation analysis for clinical variant classification. For a real-case diagnostic application of the package, see Ratajska et al (2023). [The use of segregation analysis in interpretation of sequence variants in SMAD3](https://doi.org/10.1002/mgg3.2107).

## Installation

You can install **segregatr** from CRAN as follows:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("segregatr")
```

Alternatively, obtain the latest development version from GitHub:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("magnusdv/segregatr")
```

## Example

```{r, message=F}
library(segregatr)
```

The family below shows four brothers, all affected with a rare dominant disease with 90% penetrance and phenocopy rate 1%. The parents have unknown affection status. All four brothers are shown to carry a candidate variant.

```{r sibex, echo = F, results = F, fig.height = 2.4, fig.width = 3.5, out.width = "45%"}
x = nuclearPed(4)
plotSegregation(x, affected = 3:6, unknown = 1:2, proband = 3, carriers = 3:6)
```

We will use **segregatr** to analyse the co-segregation of the variant and the disease in this pedigree. Specifically we want to compute the *full-likelihood Bayes factor* (FLB), quantifying the evidence that the variant is pathogenic.

To create the pedigree we use the `nuclearPed()` function from the **pedtools** package, which is automatically loaded together with **segregatr**.

```{r}
x = nuclearPed(4)
```

Then we run the `FLB()` function, filling in the necessary data:
```{r}
FLB(x, carriers = 3:6, affected = 3:6, unknown = 1:2,
    freq = 0.0001, penetrances = c(0.01, 0.9, 0.9), proband = 3)
```

The resulting FLB score amounts to *suggestive evidence* for pathogenicity, according to the thresholds suggested by [Jarvik and Browning (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.04.003).
